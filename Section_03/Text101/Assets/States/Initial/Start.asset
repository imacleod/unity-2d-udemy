  storyText: "You awake on the beach of a desert island with no memory of how you
    got there. The sun radiates heat at high noon while you regain your senses and
    realize the painful thirst that you're harboring.\n\nA quick survey of your immediate
    surroundings shows two items of interest; a rowboat on the beach and a small hut
    on the edge of the jungle interior.\r\n\r\nWhich do you want to inspect?\r\n1.
    Rowboat\r\n2. Hut"
