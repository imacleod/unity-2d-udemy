  storyText: 'Thankfully this chest is unlocked. You open it, noticing a scent of
    rich mahogany. The chest contains a single item, a velvet bag that you quickly
    untie.


    In this bag is an autobiography that you begin to read. The more you read it the
    more memories start flooding back. You remember who you are and how you got here.
    At last, you have found peace.


    What next?

    1. Return to start and play again
